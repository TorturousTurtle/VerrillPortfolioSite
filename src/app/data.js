        "Weight Gym! was the first mobile app I had the pleasure to build. A friend was looking for an app that had a different look and feel to the apps he was trying at the time, and he asked me to build a prototype for him. Using a React Native frontend and Firebase for the backend, Weight Gym! allows user to pre-build and schedule workouts or build them on the fly. It tracked the work they did for each workout, which could be analyzed later on in a calendar view. Users could use the exercises built into the app or add their own based on type. The app would also calculate their BMI, TDEE, and other metrics based on their activity levels and body types so they had a better idea for what to aim for with their fitness goals. It also tracked their personal bests, such as the most weight lifted during a deadlift, and update the user when they beat them. It was a blast to build!",

      description:
      "Nihongo Vocab was a personal project that got it's start with my desire to want to learn Japanese. There are many language and learning apps out there, but I wanted something customized to how I learn best. It began as a simple flash card app, but I soon found myself adding more and more features. Users can shuffle their cards, start with the answer first, or use hints if they simply can't understand the Kanji. The app tracks the users progress, showing how well they've answered each Kaniji they've viewed so far or show a list of the ones that need the most practice. Random quiz buttons will start quizzes based only on Kanji the user has seen so far. Or, the user can use the Least Practiced buttons to get quizzed on the Kanji they need the most help with.",
