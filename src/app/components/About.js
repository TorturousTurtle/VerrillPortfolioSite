            Hi, I&apos;m Ben.
            <br className="hidden lg:inline-block" />I think and I Build Things
          </h1>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Over a decade in technology sales? Check. Constant drive to be
            better and continue learning? You bet. But despite the work I was
            doing, a few years back I realized something. I love building.
            There&apos;s just something about turning a spark of an idea into a
            full-blown application that lights me up. It wasnâ€™t enough to simply
            be selling ideas that others turned into things. I wanted to make
            them too!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Between balancing a full-time gig, chasing around two energetic
            boys, and somehow finding time to pursue a degree, I recently ended
            up getting a Computer Science degree from Southern New Hampshire
            University and graduating summa cum laude. Not too shabby, right?
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Now, I built this portfolio website as my playground. It&apos;s
            where I can show off the projects that I&apos;ve built from scratch
            in the little free time I have available. It&apos;s proof that I
            don&apos;t just code - I think, I design, and most importantly, I
            create. Sure, my sales background gave me some great soft skills.
            But developing and creating? That&apos;s what gets me fired up.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            So go ahead, take a look around. See something you like? Want to
            create something awesome together? Feel free to reach out.
            Can&apos;t wait to see what we&apos;re going to build next.
